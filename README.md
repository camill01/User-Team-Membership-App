User Team Membership App

The Team Membership App is available in two flavors, one SDK 1.0 for isolated installations, and the other as SDK 2.0 for on-demand customers.

This basic app displays a table of User First, Last, and Display Names, plus a list of each Team/Project for which that user is a member.
